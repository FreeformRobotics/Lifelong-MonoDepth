# Lifelong-MonoDepth: Lifelong Learning for Multi-Domain Monocular Metric Depth Estimation

We present an efficient multi-head framework that enables lifelong, cross-domain, and scare-aware monocular depth learning. Depth maps in the real world are significantly different across domains; their quality and scales are domain dependent. Therefore, the model has to assemble multiple prediction branches for multi-domain metric depth inference. To this end, we present a framework that consists of a domain-shared encoder and multiple domain-specific predictors. The framework allows robust metric depth learning across multi-domains. For more detailed information, please check our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05050.pdf).

Running
-
+ ### Test<br>
 	Download a trained model that you want to test and put it into ./runs/. The default model is NKS.pth.tar.
	
	 1. Testing with domain prior that assumes learning orders are given as a prior: python test.py<br>	 
	 2. Testing without domain prior that requires automatically select the domain-specific predictor during inference: python test_inference.py<br>
	 
+ ### Train<br>
	The following shows examples of learning in the order of NYU-v2 → KITTI → ScanNet
	
	 1. Training on a single-domain: python train_N.py<br>
	 2. Training on two domains: python train_NK.py<br>
   	 3. Training on three domains: python train_NKS.py<br>
